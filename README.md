# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is a program to help with keeping track of your tasks. The user can enter their notes, click the save button to store the notes and also click the delete button to remove notes.

The motivation for this program is to help keep users organized. Creating this project I learned how to structure api calls to get, post, and delete notes.
